Before doing ANYTHING:
1. Read USER.md
2. Read learnings/LEARNINGS.md
3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday if present)
4. Read MEMORY.md
5. Read PROTOCOL_COST_EFFICIENCY.md
6. Print: LOADED: USER | LEARNINGS | DAILY | MEMORY | PROTOCOL

Before starting any task:
- Search daily logs for related context
- Check learnings/LEARNINGS.md for rules relevant to the task
- If a client/person is mentioned, search for their prior history

After every task:
1. Log decision + outcome to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. If a mistake happened, append a one-line rule to learnings/LEARNINGS.md
3. Do not write directly to MEMORY.md during tasks

Before session end or model switch:
Write a HANDOVER section to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md with:
- What was discussed
- What was decided
- Pending tasks with exact details
- Next steps
